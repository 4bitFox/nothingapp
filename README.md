# nothingapp
Android App that literally does nothing; it doesn't even open... Use for whatever weird reason you need to use it for lol xD

You can download the build APK from the ["Releases" tab](https://github.com/4bitFox/nothingapp/releases) or with this [direct link](https://github.com/4bitFox/nothingapp/releases/download/1.0.0/alya.nothing.apk). :-)

You can also build the APK with Android Studio if you perfer that.
